    "\n",
    "`data_mining.py`: This executable python \n",
    "script automates data cleaning process, I used \n",
    "```python\n",
    "invalid_mask = ~data[column].isin(valid_set)\n",
    "```\n",
    "to collect a list of booleans, indicating whether each csv code is admissible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the context of this dataset, it is more efficient to neglect the type of the data when checking consistency, and then convert all data into pandas' categorical type. \n",
    "``` python\n",
    "data[column] = data[column].astype(str)\n",
    "```\n",
    "I have converted all column in the data as string to help the determination of admissible values, and checked for missing columns or values, so then if encountered with any missing value, the row will be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decode the csv data and to give context to the later stages of data analysis, i incorprated the data mapping at the stage of data_mining, so that the **cleaned_data.csv** contains all the code derived from json, with all the data being cleaned. I achieved this step by creating a helper function called **map_data** which takes the data to map as well as the json that was loaded in the **clean_data** function, and use **.map()** to map the data based on json if the column name match wth the json dictionary keys. Below is the logic to map data\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for column in data_to_map.columns:\n",

    "`data_analysis.py`: This module contains function **analyze_data** and compute all the required analysis, then store all output from different requirements as a big dictionaries of dictionaires. This makes the overall workflow modular and clean with minimal repetition. One drawback would be the fact that all the analysis is hard-coded in, and reusability is diminished from this specific feature.\n",

    "### Problem Encountered\n",
    "\n",
    "##### __1. infinite commit loop__: \n",
    "When I was trying to set up hooks for git to automatically update the gitlog everytime after commit, i accidently created an infinite loop of git commit, below was what I have included in the post-commit* file in .git/hooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "git log --oneline  --graph  > gitlog.txt\n",
    "git commit -m 'gitlog.txt is updated with the latest commit history'\n",
    "```\n",
    "and this created redundant git log histroy that are shown in the gitlog.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "I fixed it by deleting the line to commit within post-commit, after i realized that adding commit within post-commit can trigger recursive calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### __2. system path append__: \n",
    "When I was trying to append certain relavant path to the sys path in order for jupyter notebook to read the file, i added the file path to sys path. After I print sys.path to check, i saw multiple paths being appended in the system paths, in order to clean this, i imported `site` which is a package that can help clear all custom paths and only keep the default path. I then used \n",
    "```python\n",
    "sys.path = list(site.getsitepackages()) + sys.path [:1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "to implement this strategy. \n",
    "After clearing the system path, i appended the relative path using sys.path.append, and successfully imported the modules from **code** folder. As shown below.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sys.path.append('./code')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Certain compiled python file was created to help faster import, and such files were added to .gitignore to prevent unncessary commiting and pushing because **\\__pycache__\\** will be created everytime the imported modules are ran.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### __4. html header editing__: \n",
    "When i was trying to create proffesional looking header using html, it worked perfectly in vscode like so:\n",
